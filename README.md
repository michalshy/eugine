# EUGINE GAME ENGINE
## 3D built on OpenGL, GLM, GLFW, GLAD, and PhysX

This repository contains the source code for a custom 3D game engine built on top of several powerful libraries, including **OpenGL**, **GLM**, **GLFW**, **GLAD**, and **PhysX**. The engine is designed to provide developers with the tools they need to create high-performance 3D games and simulations.

### Features:
- **Rendering with OpenGL**: Efficient and flexible rendering pipeline using OpenGL to support modern graphics features like shaders, lighting, and texture mapping.
- **Mathematics with GLM**: Utilizes the GLM (OpenGL Mathematics) library to handle transformations, vectors, matrices, and other critical math operations for 3D game development.
- **Window and Input Management with GLFW**: Provides window creation, user input handling (keyboard, mouse, etc.), and event-driven programming, making it easier to manage cross-platform game windows.
- **OpenGL Function Loading with GLAD**: GLAD is used for loading OpenGL extensions, ensuring compatibility with a wide range of GPUs and OpenGL versions.
- **Physics with NVIDIA PhysX**: Includes PhysX integration for realistic physics simulations, including collision detection, rigid body dynamics, and more.

### Installation:
To get started, simply clone this repository and follow the build instructions in the `README.md` file.

### Key Features:
- will be provided when game engine will be functional

### Getting Started:
- Clone the repository:  
  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/michalshy/eugine.git
  ```
- Follow the instructions to build the engine and set up your first 3D project.

### Contributing:
Contributions are welcome! Feel free to open issues, suggest improvements, or submit pull requests.
